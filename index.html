    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I am very passionate in the world of development. Since the time I wrote my first line of code I was fascinated by how we as individuals can manipulate and manage software by only the tips of our fingernails. The idea of bringing a thought to reality on a screen. This fascination has turned me into a dedicated developer contributing towards building innovative applications. </p>
    
        <p>My skills dwell in both front-end and back-end development, from designing complex, responsive UI to managing and manipulating databases. I love a fast paced work environment, the ability to work in teams and bring our own individual skills and minds together to solve real world solutions is something I thrive in.</p>
    
        <p>But after my technical skills, I know what sets me apart is my ability to problem solve in hectic environments. Im a hard worker who enjoys overcoming obstacles and conquering them, I believe it brings growth to an individual. Whether its trouble shooting, debugging code, or learning new syntax. I wouldn't be where I am today If I wasnâ€™t willing to overcome these challenges.</p>
    
        <p>n my free time, I like to take the time in exploring new techniques and skills when it comes to new technologies or softwares, studying data and understanding how it can be managed, I use these new things I learn and implement them into innovative projects. Tech is always evolving and advancing so I have a strong belief in adapting to these new things, I feel like its the key to building impactful applications.</p>
    
        <p>At my core, Im not simply jus a developer, Im an individual who solves problems, contributes to teams, someone who enjoys the art of turing simple ideas into complex software we use in our everyday lives.</p>
